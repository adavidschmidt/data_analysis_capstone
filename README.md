# data_analysis_capstone

## Description
This repository contains two files. The first is an excel document containing data from a company regarding their turnover rate. The second item is a Jupyter Notebook containing analysis done on the data to determine possible causes of the turnover and data models to help predict turnover.


- The goal of this project was to provide stakeholders with information to help make business decisions or aid in future research into the current issue.

- This project was built to develope and understand the data provided and to be able to answer the questions brought to me by stakeholders

- The business question for this particular data set is what causes employees to leave the company. The goal of the project was to answer this question and provide insights based on EDA and models developed during analysis.

- Through completing this project, I learned several different items regarding machine learning and model development to assist in answering the business question and providing key insights from the data.


Note: the data was taken from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program through Coursera.org and is not based on real data.
