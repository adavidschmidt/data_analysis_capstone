## Description
This repository contains two files. The first is an Excel document containing data from a company regarding its turnover rate. The second item is a Jupyter Notebook containing analysis done on the data to determine possible causes of the turnover and data models to help predict turnover.

- Provided stakeholders with information to help make business decisions or aid in future research into the current issue.
- Developed and understand the data provided and to be able to answer the questions brought to me by stakeholders
- Provided deep insight and analysis into potential causes of employee turnover rates.
- Through completing this project, I learned several different items regarding machine learning and model development to assist in answering the business question and providing key insights from the data.
